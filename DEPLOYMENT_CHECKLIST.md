# 📋 GCP Cloud Run Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure a smooth deployment to Google Cloud Run.

---

## Pre-Deployment Preparation

### Local Changes (On Your Windows PC)

- [ ] Backend code is up to date with all recent changes
- [ ] `.env` file exists in Backend/ with all required values
- [ ] Firebase service account JSON file exists in Backend/
- [ ] All recent features tested locally:
  - [ ] Admin password change works
  - [ ] New authentication endpoints work
  - [ ] App runs without Redis (check logs)

### Upload to Codespace

- [ ] Upload entire Backend/ folder to GitHub Codespace
- [ ] Verify all files transferred correctly
- [ ] `.env` file present in Codespace
- [ ] Firebase JSON file present in Codespace

---

## In Your GitHub Codespace (Linux)

### 1. Environment Setup

- [ ] gcloud CLI installed (`gcloud --version`)
- [ ] Docker installed (`docker --version`)
- [ ] Authenticated with gcloud (`gcloud auth list`)
- [ ] Correct GCP project set (`gcloud config get-value project`)

### 2. Install Dependencies

cd Backend
npm install redis
```

- [ ] Redis package added to package.json
- [ ] package-lock.json updated
- [ ] No npm errors

### 3. Secret Manager Setup

**Option A: Automated (Recommended)**

```bash
chmod +x setup-secrets.sh
./setup-secrets.sh
```

**Option B: Manual**
Create each secret individually (see DEPLOY_QUICK_START.md)

**Verify all secrets created:**

```bash
gcloud secrets list
```

Required secrets checklist:

- [ ] DB_CONNECTION_STRING
- [ ] DB_NAME
- [ ] FCM_SERVER_KEY
- [ ] FCM_SENDER_ID
- [ ] GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

- [ ] UPI_NOTE_PREFIX
- [ ] AUTO_VERIFY_CLAIMS
- [ ] JWT_SECRET (NEW)
- [ ] ADMIN_API_KEY (NEW)
- [ ] REDIS_URL (NEW - Upstash configured! ✅)
- [ ] CDN_PROVIDER (NEW)
- [ ] CDN_DOMAIN (NEW)
- [ ] CDN_PREFIX (NEW)
- [ ] GEOCODE_SERVER_FALLBACK (NEW)
- [ ] ALLOWED_ORIGINS (NEW)

### 4. Deploy to Cloud Run

**Option A: Automated (Recommended)**

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

**Option B: Manual**
Follow commands in DEPLOY_QUICK_START.md

Deployment checklist:

- [ ] Docker image built successfully
- [ ] Image pushed to registry
- [ ] Cloud Run service deployed
- [ ] No errors in deployment output
- [ ] Service URL received

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Basic Health Check

```bash
# Get service URL
gcloud run services describe easy-backend --region=asia-south1 --format="value(status.url)"

# Test health endpoint
curl YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL/health
```

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Response includes status: "OK"
- [ ] Database status: "connected"
- [ ] Firebase status: true

### 2. Check Logs

```bash
gcloud run logs tail easy-backend --region=asia-south1 --limit=100
```

Expected log messages:

- [ ] "MongoDB: Connected successfully"
- [ ] "Firebase Admin SDK initialized"
- [ ] "Server running on port 8080"
- [ ] "Redis: Connecting..."
- [ ] "Redis: Connected and ready"
- [ ] "✅ Redis caching enabled"

**NO errors about:**

- [ ] Missing secrets
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Firebase initialization errors

### 3. Test API Endpoints

**Test admin login:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL/api/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-admin@email.com","password":"your-password"}'
```

- [ ] Returns JWT token
- [ ] Status 200 OK
- [ ] No authentication errors

**Test password change (with token from above):**

```bash
curl -X PUT https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL/api/admin/change-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"currentPassword":"old","newPassword":"new123"}'
```

- [ ] Password change works (or returns appropriate error)

### 4. Update CORS Configuration

```bash
# Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS to include your Cloud Run URL
echo -n "https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL,http://localhost:3000" | \
  gcloud secrets versions add ALLOWED_ORIGINS --data-file=-

# Redeploy to pick up new secret
gcloud run services update easy-backend --region=asia-south1
```

- [ ] ALLOWED_ORIGINS secret updated
- [ ] Service redeployed
- [ ] CORS working from Flutter app

---

## Flutter App Configuration

### Update API URL

**In your Flutter app:**

1. Update API_BASE_URL constant or environment variable
2. Rebuild the app

```dart
// Update this in your Flutter code:
const String apiBaseUrl = 'https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL';
```

Or use environment variable:

```bash
flutter build apk --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL
```

- [ ] API_BASE_URL updated in Flutter code or build command
- [ ] Flutter app rebuilt
- [ ] New APK generated

### Test from Mobile App

- [ ] App connects to Cloud Run backend
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] Password change feature works
- [ ] No CORS errors
- [ ] All features working as expected

## ✅ Redis Already Configured!

**Your Upstash Redis is set up and working!**

### Current Setup Verification

- [x] Upstash account created
- [x] Redis database created
- [x] REDIS_URL configured in .env: `rediss://...@advanced-bulldog-34907.upstash.io:6379`
- [x] Local testing successful - logs show "Redis: Connected and ready"
- [x] TLS encryption enabled (rediss:// protocol)
- [x] Free tier: 10,000 requests/day

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] `.env` file has Upstash REDIS_URL (already done locally)
- [ ] `setup-secrets.sh` will create REDIS_URL secret in GCP
- [ ] Deploy with `deploy.sh`
- [ ] Verify logs show:
  - "Redis: Connecting..."
  - "Redis: Connected and ready"
  - "✅ Redis caching enabled"
- [ ] Test API performance (should be faster with caching)

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Faster API responses (cached data)
- ✅ Reduced database load
- ✅ Better scalability
- ✅ Global edge network (Upstash)
- ✅ No additional cost (free tier)

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Checks

Daily:

- [ ] Check error logs: `gcloud run logs read easy-backend --region=asia-south1 --filter="severity>=ERROR"`
- [ ] Monitor Cloud Run metrics in GCP Console

Weekly:

- [ ] Review Cloud Run costs
- [ ] Check request count and latency
- [ ] Review MongoDB Atlas usage

Monthly:

- [ ] Rotate JWT_SECRET and ADMIN_API_KEY
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Check for Cloud Run updates/recommendations

### Useful Commands

```bash
# View real-time logs
gcloud run logs tail easy-backend --region=asia-south1 --follow

# Check service status
gcloud run services describe easy-backend --region=asia-south1

# List all revisions
gcloud run revisions list --service=easy-backend --region=asia-south1

# Rollback to previous revision (if needed)
gcloud run services update-traffic easy-backend --region=asia-south1 --to-revisions=REVISION_NAME=100

# View metrics
gcloud run services describe easy-backend --region=asia-south1 --format=yaml
```

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If deployment fails:

- [ ] Check build logs: Look for npm install errors
- [ ] Verify all secrets exist: `gcloud secrets list`
- [ ] Check secret values: `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=SECRET_NAME`
- [ ] Verify Docker build: Build locally first to test
- [ ] Check MongoDB Atlas whitelist: Must allow 0.0.0.0/0
- [ ] Verify Firebase JSON file: Must be in Backend/ folder

If health check fails:

- [ ] Check logs for errors: `gcloud run logs read easy-backend --region=asia-south1 --limit=100`
- [ ] Test database connection: Check MongoDB Atlas status
- [ ] Verify secrets are mounted: Check environment in Cloud Run console
- [ ] Test locally first: `npm start` in Backend/

If CORS errors occur:

- [ ] Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes Cloud Run URL
- [ ] Check frontend is using correct API URL
- [ ] Verify secret was updated: `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- [ ] Ensure service was redeployed after secret update

## Cost Tracking

Keep track of your GCP costs:

Current configuration costs (estimate):

- Cloud Run: $5-10/month (low traffic)
- Secret Manager: ~$0.30/month
- Container Registry/Artifact Registry: ~$1-2/month
- MongoDB Atlas: $0-9/month (depending on tier)

**Total: ~$6-21/month** (without Redis)

With Redis (Memorystore Basic): Add ~$30-40/month

- [ ] Set up billing alerts in GCP Console
- [ ] Monitor costs weekly
- [ ] Review usage monthly
