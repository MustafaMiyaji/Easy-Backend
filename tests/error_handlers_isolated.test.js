/**
 * Isolated Error Handler Tests
 *
 * These tests MUST run in a separate file to avoid Jest module caching conflicts.
 *
 * Context:
 * - products.test.js:880 and restaurants.test.js:541 were skipped due to mock interference
 * - When run with full test suite, Jest's module caching causes the mocks to persist
 * - Running in isolation allows proper mock cleanup between tests
 *
 * Target Coverage:
 * - routes/products.js lines 59-60 (Product.find error handler)
 * - routes/restaurants.js lines 99-100 (Seller.aggregate error handler)
